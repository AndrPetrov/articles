## The problem
How we know what we have to do right now, since 1 hour and tomorrow? Usually it is just our memory and ability to remind something in right time and right place. In some cases it works well but anyway this definitely can be improved.

## The solution
There are a tons of books about time management and a lot of tracking systems in the field. But I'm happy that the first one that I have read was [Максим Дорофеев, "Джедайские техники"][link_jedai_book]. This book is one of the best on my opinion for beginners in self management tecniques. This book:
1. Helps to create and organize your task list in very clear way.
2. Shows best practices how to translate your task from mind into easy-to-read sentence.
3. Shows hot to free up your RAM and think only about current task.
4. How to wisely use your everyday refillable resources.

Also there are a lot of references on another more deep and teoretical literature but if you are novice, like I am, this book is a good start.

## Tools that I use
Every developer has its own toolset so here is mine.

### Todoist
I have tried a couple of web apps and mobile application for task management and figured out that the most suitable for me is [Todoist][link_todoist]. Its features:
1. Very clean and comfortable web interface.
2. A bunch of clients for PC, mac, android, iOS.
3. Own [DSL][link_dsl] that helps to create tasks very fast without any additional clicks and interactions, only keyboard. And I really like this feature, for example you can type `#Personal today start listenning to new podcast series` and todoist will automatically create task for `Personal` project for today. This ability makes this feature really useful.
4. Calendars integration.
5. Free plans that cover 99% of everyday requirements.
6. Every day and overall score. It sounds like senseless feature but if you like to contest yourself and have some kind of statistics and visualizations this feature can give you this.

### Usual calendar
Everybody uses calendars but if you itegrate todoist into your calendar this bundle becomes really powerful.

## Sum up
Knowledge from that book and described tools are very useful for me in everyday activities and I hope you can find something interesting in them for you too.
